\section{The Ant and the Dove}

An ant went to the bank of a river to quench its thirst, and
being carried away by the rush of the stream, was on the
point of drowning.

A Dove\marginpar{Pigeon, an emblem of peace.}
sitting on a tree overhanging the water plucked a
leaf and let it fall into the stream close to her. The Ant
climbed onto it and floated in safety to the bank.

\section{The Dog in the Manger}

A dog lay in a manger, and by his growling and snapping
prevented the oxen from eating the hay which had been
placed for them.

``What a selfish Dog!'' said one of them to his companions;
``he cannot eat the hay himself, and yet refuses to allow
those to eat who can.''

\chapter{The Eagle and the Arrow}

An eagle sat on a lofty rock, watching the movements of a
Hare whom he sought to make his prey.

An archer, who saw the Eagle from a place of concealment,
took an accurate aim and wounded him mortally.
